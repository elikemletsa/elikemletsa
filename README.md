- 👋 Hi, I’m @elikemletsa
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Programming, 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Science at Ho Technical University(HTU)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with both well renowned and beginners in programming to make each others aspirations in programming come through 
- 📫 How to reach me on WhatsApp or Call (0542461471)

- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know the term "bug" in programming actually came from a real, live bug? In 1947, a moth got stuck in a Harvard Mark II computer, causing it to malfunction. Grace Hopper and her team removed the insect and documented the event, coining the term "debugging" in the process!


I hope to enjoy my ride 😎🤩
